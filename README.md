# Python-challenge

Pybank

This portion of the project involved the creation of a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company starting from a CSV file ("budget_data.csv" in the "Resources" folder, which holds two columns: profit and date). When run, the Python script (main.py) is set up to: 

Create variables and empty lists to hold values for profit and date.

Read through the data by way of for loop.

Calculate the net changes to profit and save the new values.

Calculate summary statistics and totals (eg. total months, greatest increase, worst date etc.)

After calculation, the script uses several print statements to present a report on the analysis to the user.



PyPoll

This part of the challenge focused on developing a script to aid in counting votes in an election based on source data from a CSV file ("election_data.csv" in the "Resources" folder, which holds three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate). When run, the Python script (main.py) is set up to:

Create variables and empty lists to hold values for candidate names, vote count, and percentage of total votes.

Read through the data by way of for loop.

Calculate the total number of votes per candidate starting a new count for a candidate if their name had not yet been encountered.

Calculate the percentage of overall votes each candidate had.

After calculation, the script uses several print statements to present a report on the analysis to the user.
