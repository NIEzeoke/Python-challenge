# Python-challenge

Pybank

This portion of the project involved the creation of a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company starting from a CSV file ("budget_data.csv" in the "Resources" folder, which holds two columns: profit and date). When run, the Python script (main.py) is set up to: 

Create variables and empty lists to hold values for profit and date.
Read through the data by way of for loop.
Calculate the net changes to profit and save the new values.
Calculate summary statistics and totals (eg. total months, greatest increase, worst date etc.)
After calculation, the script uses several print statements to present a report to the user.
